  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>You are on an Erasmus trip in Italy. On the first day of the trip you are visiting the University of Padua, where Galileo Galilei, the father of the scientific method, was appointed as the first chair of mathematics and physics and taught for 18 years. You have gathered in the auditorium to watch a video presentation when suddenly the presentation is interrupted by a video stream from one of the laboratories at the university. A crazy looking scientist yells:</p>

<p>I want to be the next Galileo Galilei! I have his original scripts and formulae! I will hide them from the rest of the world, and nobody will see them ever again!</p>

<p>You look at each other in surprise, as the camera the scientist is using for the stream shows him putting something in a metal box. Then the stream is cut off.</p>

<p>The student hosting you says that they recognised the room where the stream was coming from. It was one of the laboratories in the basement.</p>

<p>Start your adventure by typing 'start'.</p>

  <h2>Task 1</h2>
  <p>You follow the student and find the laboratory. There is a digital lock, and the door won’t open. But what is the code to open the door?

One of you finds a piece of paper from behind the lock. On the paper, there are four sentences with four options, each labeled 1–4. You have to crack the code by choosing the correct option and assembling the correct, four-number code.</p>

<p><b>1. much / 2. many / 3. a little / 4. a few</b></p>

<p> I only need ____ luck to succeed.</p>
<p>We don't have ____ time left.</p>
<p> There a so ____ tasks left to solve.</p>
<p>There's not a lot of us, but I'm glad to have ____ friends doing this task with me.</p>

<div id="ques2" class="ques">
  <h2>Task 2</h2>
  <p>The door opens, but the room behind it is not a laboratory. It is a sort of a waiting room. There is a padlock attached to the door at the back of the room. Another code is missing.  

Your friend finds a pile of papers on the desk, and starts going through them. There is a handout with strange words.  

Rearrange the jumbled letters and create words related to traffic. Take the first letter of each word to create the code for the padlock. </p>

<p>1. al gang tilt – You’re too close!</p>
<p>2. nova aiti – In the air </p>
<p>3. ruins acne – Better to be safe than sorry! </p>
<p>4. cuter mom – Regular traveller </p>
<p>5. urged rod run – Down below </p>
<p>6. okra sword – Slowing you down</p>
<p>7. evoke art – Let’s go faster!</p>
<p>8. diviner so – The long way round</p>

  <h2>Task 3</h2>
  <p>The code is correct, and you finally step in the laboratory. It is pitch black. You are looking for the light switch, when the door closes behind you. You turn the lights on, and one of you tries to open the door to the waiting room, but it doesn’t open! You are trapped inside the laboratory.</p>

<p>You suddenly hear an announcement from the loudspeaker:</p>

<p>I won’t let you stop me. You’ll never get out of the laboratory unless you are as smart as Galileo himself!</p>

<p>A strange text flashes up on one of the computer screens:</p>

<p>/juːl faɪnd ðə fɜːst kluː nɪə ðə ˈfɔːmjʊliː ɒn ðə dɛsk/.</p>
<p>Where is the next clue?.</p>
